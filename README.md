# Trusts 2024

## Overview
A trust is established when there is a separation of legal ownership from the beneficial ownership of an asset. Trusts are created for various purposes, such as holding investment assets, providing superannuation benefits, or ensuring the deceased's family members are provided for. Trusts are governed by state law and are not defined in the ITAA.

## Trust Terminology
- **Settlor**: The person who creates the trust and transfers property to the trustee.
- **Trust Deed**: A document outlining the terms of the trust, including the powers of the trustee and the beneficiaries.
- **Trust Property (Corpus)**: The property held under trust, such as money, real estate, or shares.
- **Trustee**: The person or entity with legal title to the trust property but no benefit from it. The trustee owes a duty of care to the beneficiaries.
- **Beneficiaries**: The individuals or entities who benefit from the trust. Beneficiaries can be people or objects (e.g., a trust for a charitable purpose).
- **Legal Disability**: Conditions that prevent a beneficiary from claiming their share, such as being a minor or having a mental incapacity.
- **Present Entitlement**: A beneficiaryâ€™s right to receive trust income that is legally available and has an absolute interest.
- **Inter-Vivos Trust**: A trust created during the life of the settlor.
- **Will Trusts**: Trusts that arise upon the death of the settlor and are managed according to the terms of the will.
- **Vesting Day**: The day the trust terminates, and the beneficiaries are entitled to the trust property.

## Liability of the Trustee
A trustee is answerable as the taxpayer for income derived by the trust but is not personally liable for the taxes unless they fail to retain sufficient funds to pay them.

## Types of Trusts
- **Discretionary Trusts**: The trustee has discretion over how much income to distribute to beneficiaries.
- **Fixed Trusts**: Beneficiaries receive predetermined shares of the trust estate.
- **Unit Trusts**: A variation of fixed trusts where ownership is divided into fixed units.
- **Deceased Estate Trusts**: Trusts created from the assets of a deceased individual.
- **Family Trusts**: Trusts that distribute income to family members.
- **Testamentary Trusts**: Trusts established by a will to manage the deceased estate property.

## Net Trust Income (NTI)
NTI is the trust's assessable income for the year minus allowable deductions. Trust deductions do not include personal expenses paid on behalf of beneficiaries.

## Taxation of Trusts
A trust is not a separate taxable entity, but it must file a tax return. Trust income is taxed based on whether the beneficiary is presently entitled and whether they are under a legal disability. If no beneficiary is entitled, the trustee is taxed at the highest marginal rate.

## Trust Losses
Trust losses are retained and carried forward to offset against future trust income. Special trust loss tests apply to discretionary and fixed trusts.

## Miscellaneous
- **Franking Credits**: Beneficiaries entitled to franked dividend income from a trust can claim a franking tax offset.
- **Capital Gains**: Trusts can apply the 50% CGT discount and small business CGT concessions where applicable.
